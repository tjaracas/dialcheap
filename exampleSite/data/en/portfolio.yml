    content: SIP-T19P E2 The SIP-T19P E2 is one of Yealink's latest answers for the
      entry-level IP Phone that offers features and performance normally associated
      with much more advanced phones. The quite intentional choice of high-quality
      materials, combined with a generously large 132x64-pixel graphical LCD that
      gives a clear 5-line display, guarantees both a smoother user experience and
      easier access to much more visual information at a glance. Dual 10/100 Mbps
      network ports with integrated PoE are ideal for extended network use. The SIP-T19P
      E2 supports single VoIP account, simple, flexible and secure installation options,
      plus IPv6 and SRTP/HTTPS/TLS, VLAN and QoS. It includes headset use, wall-mountable
      and has been designed very specifically for better business.
